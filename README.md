### Overview
Your mission is create either:
- Life-like cellular automata [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), [life-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-like_cellular_automaton), [demo](https://www.netlogoweb.org/launch#https://www.netlogoweb.org/assets/modelslib/Sample%20Models/Computer%20Science/Cellular%20Automata/Life.nlogo).
- Breakout/Arkanoid [demo 0](https://elgoog.im/breakout/)  [demo 1](https://www.crazygames.com/game/atari-breakout)
- Space Invaders/Galaga

This project will be completed in phases. The first phase will be to work on this document. Use markdown formatting.

## Phase 0: Selection, Analysis & Plan

#### Selected Project: BREAKOUT

### Necessary Features
What are the core features that your program should have? These should be things that __must__ be implemented in order to make the program useable/playable, not extra features that could be added to make the program more interesting/fun.

:Array of bricks, once they collide wih ball they disappear, bouncing ball, and a platform where the bounce starts and bounces from, we also need a counter that monitors the amount of lives the player has, we also need a pause/play button, a function that changes the speed of the ball as game goes on, and a button to replay game. 

### Extra Features
What are some features that are not essential to the program, but you would like to see (provided you have time after completing the necessary features. Theses can be customizations that are not part of the core requirements.

Ability to change the color of the ball, size of the platform, and the color of the tiles. 

### Array Usage

### Controls
How will your program be controlled? List all keyboard commands and mouse interactions.

Keyboard Commands:
Left and right arrow keys to move the platform, the 'r' key that refreshes, space to pause and unpause the game.

Mouse Control:
- Mouse pressed: Click to start the game


### Classes
What classes will you be creating for this project? Include the instance variables and methods that you believe you will need. You will be required to create at least 2 different classes. If you are going to use classes similar to those we've made for previous assignments, you will have to add new features to them.

Ball
- Instance variables:
  x.speed, y.speed, bsize, Pvector, center
- METHODS
  - 

Platform
- Instance variables:
  - x.speed, psize, pcolor
- METHODS
